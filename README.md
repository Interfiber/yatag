Yet Another Text Adventure Game(Under Development)

## Installing

If you wish to have the 'yatag' command in your PATH you can build the .pkg installer by cloning this repo and running
```console
sh pkg-packer.sh
```
In the cloned folder. This will create a file called "Yet Another Text Adventure Game.pkg" On MacOS you can double click this file and the Installer window will popup, which you can use to install Yet Another Text Adventure Game

## Playing
To play run the 'yatag' command. This will launch the game. For a list of commands type 'help' into the console. There are no arguments in the game so if I wanted to take something I would not use 'take 1' I would use 'take' then type in the item number.
